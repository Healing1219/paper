\section{Related Tools}

Sofware tools for the analysis of probabilistic programs has not yet received much attention. 
As far as we know, the only existing tools are ProbFuzz~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigsoft/DuttaLHM18}, PSense~\cite{DBLP:conf/atva/HuangWM18} and PSI~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/GehrMV16}.
PSI is a symbolic inference tool that approximates the probability density function represented by a probabilistic program. 
PSense is an automated verification tool that generate tight upper bounds for the sensitivity of probabilistic programs over initial inputs.
ProbFuzz is a tool for testing probabilistic programs. 
Both the aforementioned tools do not consider termination analysis of probabilistic programs. 
For example, ProbFuzz focuses on testing rather than verification of probabilistic programs, 
PSI considers only inference and PSense solves sensitivity instead. 
Moreover, PSI/PSense requires that the input probabilistic while loop has a bounded number of loop iterations, while we can handle probabilistic loops with an unbounded number of loop iterations.
